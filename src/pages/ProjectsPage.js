      title: 'Multi-Language "War" Card Game Development',
      shortDescription: 'Created the classic card game "War" in Rust, SmallTalk, Ruby, and Elixir, enhancing my understanding of different programming paradigms.',
      modalDescription: 'This project was an exploration of diverse programming paradigms. I implemented the card game "War" in four distinct languages: Rust (for its performance and memory safety), SmallTalk (to explore object-oriented programming in its purest form), Ruby (to leverage its simplicity and elegance), and Elixir (to take advantage of its concurrency model). Each version of the game followed the same rules but required unique approaches due to the characteristics of the languages. This project not only strengthened my proficiency in these languages but also provided valuable insights into their different runtime behaviors, garbage collection methods, and error handling mechanisms.',

      title: 'Bowling Score Tracker Terminal in Python',
      shortDescription: 'Built a command-line Python application to track and calculate bowling scores with a focus on real-time accuracy and user interaction.',
      modalDescription: 'This Python project was aimed at creating a command-line application that accurately tracks bowling scores while handling edge cases such as strikes and spares. The terminal application features a user-friendly interface that allows multiple players to input their scores, and it calculates running totals, applying the rules of bowling for perfect accuracy. I implemented logic to manage the special cases in the game, like consecutive strikes or spares, ensuring proper score calculations. This project enhanced my problem-solving skills, especially in dealing with scoring algorithms and real-time data processing.',

      title: 'Python Anti-Recoil Script for FPS Games',
      shortDescription: 'Developed a Python script that reads mouse recoil patterns, generates an inverse vector, and applies it to neutralize recoil in FPS games.',
      modalDescription: 'For this project, I created an anti-recoil Python script that reads and analyzes the recoil patterns of various firearms in first-person shooter (FPS) games. The script captures mouse movement data during recoil, converts it into a vector, and then inverts this vector to create an anti-recoil effect. When activated, the script moves the mouse in the opposite direction of the recoil to neutralize it, allowing for precise aiming and near-zero recoil. This project improved my skills in vector math, data capture from hardware inputs, and the ethical considerations of creating game scripts. It was an exciting intersection of gaming and programming.',
